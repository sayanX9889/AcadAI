## Key Features

### Student Dashboard

A centralized dashboard providing access to:

- Academic overview
- Attendance
- Study plan
- Academic performance
- Notifications
- AI chatbot
- AI quizzes
- Academic profile

---

### Academic Profile

Students can maintain their academic information, including:

- Personal academic details
- Subjects
- Semester information
- Academic history

Academic profile data can be retrieved and updated through the backend API.

---

### Attendance Tracking

Students can view their attendance information and monitor their academic attendance.

---

### AI Study Plan

The system provides study-plan functionality to help students organize their academic preparation.

---

### AI Academic Advisor

Students can interact with an AI-powered chatbot for academic assistance.

The advisor can be used for questions related to:

- Subjects
- Study preparation
- Academic concepts
- Learning guidance
- General academic assistance

---

### AI Quiz Generator

Students can enter a subject or topic they currently find difficult.

The system then generates a 10-question quiz based on the provided topic.

Quiz workflow:

1. Student selects **Quiz**
2. Student enters the subject/topic
3. AI generates 10 questions
4. Student answers the questions
5. Student submits the quiz
6. Score is calculated instantly
7. Correct answers are displayed
8. Results are shown immediately

Quiz marks are intentionally **not stored in the database**.

This keeps the quiz feature as an instant self-assessment tool rather than an academic grading system.

> **Academic Integrity Declaration:**  
> Students are encouraged to attempt quizzes independently without using AI or external assistance. The purpose of the quiz is self-assessment, identifying knowledge gaps, and improving learning. Using AI to obtain answers defeats the purpose of the assessment and ultimately harms the student's own learning and academic growth.

---

### Notification System

The backend supports:

- Individual student notifications
- Broadcast notifications
- Notification retrieval
- Marking notifications as read

Administrators can send notifications through the backend API.

---

### Feedback System

Students can submit feedback through the platform.

# API Documentation
FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation.
Swagger UI:
```
/docs
```
# Database Design
The application stores student-related information in structured database tables.
Major data areas include:
```
Users
 ├── Academic Profiles
 ├── Academic Subjects
 ├── Academic Semesters
 ├── Notifications
 ├── Feedback
 ├── Email Verifications
 └── Profile Pictures
```
Quiz scores are not persisted in the database.

# Privacy & Security
The project follows several security principles:
- Sensitive credentials are stored in environment variables.
- API keys are not hard-coded into source files.
- Gmail App Passwords are used for SMTP authentication.
- Password reset codes are sent through registered email addresses.
- Password recovery uses verification codes.
- Quiz scores are not permanently stored.
- Administrative notification endpoints use a dedicated admin key.
- ```.env``` files are excluded from version control.

> **Important:** Never publish API keys, database credentials, SMTP passwords, or administrative keys in a public GitHub repository.

Production environment variables should be configured directly in the deployment platform.
